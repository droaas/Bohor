## Summary
**Bohor** is an advanced system designed for extracting and analyzing metrical patterns (taf'ilat) in classical Arabic poetry. By leveraging traditional works and advanced probabilistic modeling, Bohor provides a robust framework for understanding and generating poetic structures. This README outlines the development methodology, usage instructions, and contributions.

## Methodology

The development of the **Bohor** system involves a systematic approach, broken down into five key steps:

### Step 1: Extracting Basic Taf'ilat Patterns
In this phase, we extract the fundamental taf'ilat patterns based on the analysis of six traditional Arabic prosody works considered gold standards. The primary reference used is "القواعد العروضية وأحكام القافية العربية" (The Rules of Prosody and Arabic Rhyme). This work is supplemented by five additional references to extract the core patterns and rules from which sub-patterns will be developed.

### Step 2: Building the Probability Model
This step involves constructing a probabilistic model to compute possible sub-patterns based on the basic rules identified in Step 1. The core rules are transformed into a probabilistic framework to generate potential taf'ilat patterns for each poetic meter.

### Step 3: Handling Exceptional Cases
Based on the six traditional prosody works, we study and analyze exceptional cases that fall outside the standard rules, as well as modern poetic deviations. These exceptional cases are integrated into the probability model to ensure comprehensive coverage of all possible patterns.

### Step 4: Processing Rhyme Patterns
Rhyme patterns are extracted from the final taf'ilat of the poetic line based on specific conditions. Utilizing the six references, we study various Arabic rhyme rules and apply them to the taf'ilat pattern base. For example, the rhyme of a poetic line can be derived from the last consonant in the line to the consonant preceding it, shaping the taf'ilat patterns accordingly.

### Step 5: Generating Taf'ilat Patterns
In this final step, we generate taf'ilat patterns for each poetic meter, ensuring that any poetic line composed adheres to these patterns. This guarantees that the generated patterns align with the established metrical rules.

## Use Cases for Bohor

The **Bohor** system will be utilized to build a comprehensive solution space named **Tafilat** for all taf'ilat patterns across various Arabic prosody systems. These systems include four main types:

- **Khalil Al-Farahidi System**: Contains 16 classical meters. This system is applied to classical Arabic poetry and a specific poetic genre known as "Qaseed."
- **Modern Meters**: Includes poetic meters added to Khalil Al-Farahidi's system, such as poems in colloquial Arabic dialects with unique meters invented by contemporary poets.
- **Adopted Meters**: Features poetic meters borrowed from the poetic traditions of other languages, such as "Dopplett," which many researchers believe was borrowed from Persian prosody systems.
- **Free Verse Meter System**: With the advent of modern free verse poetry, poems have evolved to adhere solely to taf'ilat without following traditional metrical patterns, allowing more flexibility and creativity.

The **Tafilat** solution space, which will be developed using Bohor, provides a structured approach to analyzing and generating these varied poetic forms. For more information and access to the solution space, visit [Tafilat](https://github.com/yourusername/Tafilat).
